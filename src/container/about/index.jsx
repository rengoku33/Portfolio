                Well, Let's face it... If you are reading this, then you are either a recruiter or a fellow software engineer. </p><br />
            <p>
                If you are not a recruiter 
                then just skip this page and explore my projects or whatever you are here for, (honestly man...I would rather spend my time 
                building, learning, playing or watching anime) so just skedaddle and spend your time wisely.

                Now then, If you are a recruiter then buckle up... cuz I got just the thing to explain about myself

                I am Kiran Vignesh (23yrs at the time of writing this) and let's jump straight to the context, I am not an average software engineer 
                based on various aspects. (I do not belittle them, it's a wild and vast profession) let me explain why, in a completely honest and straight forward way 
                by expressing my heart out, so that you could understand my frame of mind and craft your opinion/assumption about me.

                Backstory - My first ever programming langugae was C and it was during my highschool, I was probably 16 or 17 back then and I was neither good not bad, I survived my CS101 
                classes and scored barely enough to pass my exams. Fast forward 2-3 years and now I am in college majoring in CS,(ironic, isnt it?) at this point I started investing time and effort to learn 
                JAVA and other frameworks associated with it, It was a stupendous learning curve for me. I actually had fun building basic projects and was on the top 3 in my class 
                and obliterated 3hrs exams in just an hour and scored the top ranks as well. It was my first major breakthrough in CS and I was glowing with academic knowledge 
                throughout my course duration.

                Intellect - It's 2022 and I just got my first job as a trainee at Intellect, the salary was not bad for starters, was introduced to a professional environment, worked with a 
                bunch of seniors who were just incredible mentors to me, learnt that school smart is absolutely not enough at work, and it was a perfect transition from 
                school to work environment. The truth it, I mastered the programming languages, frameworks, work flows, SDLCs we followed in under 3 months. It was a double 
                edged sword for me, GOOD in a way that proves my skills and ability to adapt new tech. BAD in a way that I got really comfortable with the environment. My daily life 
                was completely monotonous, such that my motivation to do anything became regressive. The tasks assigned to me no-longer seemed to be interesting and only consumed time with 
                little to medium effort. But hey, I was satisfied with the pay and no longer had any work pressure, Hence I 
                embraced the never ending loop of boredom.

                October 25, 2022 (The day I broke the matrix) - So, it was just another day at work and while I was on my way home, I had a motorcycle accident (My office was around 
                50kms away and I used to drive there 5 days a week). It wasnt anything serious or life threatening but I shattered my femur and was on WFH for the next couple of months. WFH as a trainee 
                wasnt great, but my team was supportive and the work load was really low. Now I had enormous amount of time, time to explore new frameworks, concepts, langugaes. I found the motivation and passion
                that I once lost by simply building projects that I wanted and learning whatever I felt like(I chose react JS), I learnt MERN stack and built a couple of projects. 
                After a while, I finally managed to land my first non-trainee role with my preferrend tech stack.

                The Tann Mann Foundation - An average software engineer would say that working at a start-up will be a nightmare since you will be the frontend, backend, IT, testing, devops etc,. 
                but I loved every part of it, I didnt actually have to carry everything since we had around 10-15 software engineers in total, grouped based on their skills and mastery. 
                I felt unshackled in a lot of ways, I dont have to raise a ticket to IT for installing software, didnt have to push my code to the testing team, didnt have to wait on other devs 
                for their response/contribution/approval, and much more. I also had genuine interactions with our CEO and was able to implement my ideas to the product. The best part is, my job 
                is WFH but occasionally WFO. so, my work-life balance has never been better and I still have time to work on my side projects every now and then. but it all comes with a cost, 
                the pay is not good and my comapany has fewer clients, once a product is pushed to production then there isnt much to do with support nad hence not much profit/funds involved.

            <p>
                In conclusion - Thats it, this is my life so far and I genuinely enojy building projects and working on challenging environments, I wish to keep learning new tech rather than sticking 
                with a particular tech stack or framework. My personal objective in life is to become a software engineer at FAANG and work on revolutionary products that has a significant 
                impact in people's daily lives. you probably skmimmed through the above blog, if not I express my heartfelt thanks for spending time to know me.

                set your heart ablaze and push beyond your limits, right here, right now
