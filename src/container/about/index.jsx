                Well, Let's face it... If you are reading this, then you are either a recruiter or a fellow software engineer. </p><br />
            <p style={{fontSize:'2.1rem'}}>
                If you are 'not' a recruiter 
                then just skip this page and explore my projects or whatever you are here for, (honestly man...I would rather spend my time 
                building, learning, playing or watching anime) so just skedaddle and spend your time wisely.

                Now then, If you are a recruiter: buckle up... cuz I got just the thing to explain about myself

            <p style={{fontSize:'2.1rem'}}>
                I am Kiran Vignesh (23yrs at the time of writing this) and let's jump straight to the context, I am not an average software engineer 
                based on various aspects. (I do not belittle them, it's a wild and vast profession) let me explain why in a way 
                that makes you understand my frame of mind and craft your opinion/assumption about me.

                Backstory - My first ever programming langugae was C and it was during my highschool, I was probably 16 or 17 back then and I was neither good nor bad, I survived my CS101 
                classes and scored barely enough to pass my exams. Fast forward 2-3 years and now I am in college majoring in CS,(ironic, isnt it?) at this point I started investing time and effort to learn 
                JAVA and other frameworks associated with it, It was a stupendous learning curve for me. I actually had fun building basic projects and was in the top 3 in my class. 
                I obliterated 3hr exams in just an hour and scored really good as well. It was my first major breakthrough in CS and I was glowing with academic knowledge 
                throughout my course duration.

                Intellect - It's 2022 and I just got my first job as a trainee at Intellect, the salary was not bad for starters, was introduced to a professional environment, worked with a 
                bunch of seniors who were just incredible mentors to me, learnt that school smart is absolutely not enough at work, and it was a perfect transition from 
                school to work environment. Honestly, I mastered the programming languages, frameworks, workflows, SDLCs we followed in under 3 months. It was a double 
                edged sword for me, GOOD because I am now really fast and efficient at work. BAD because things got boring, there was no longer any challenging tasks. My daily life 
                was completely monotonous, and at that point of time, I was ignorant of the glorious software engineering world and was stuck as a frameworker rather than an engineer. 
                But hey, I was satisfied with the pay with minimal work pressure, Hence I embraced boredom.

                October 25, 2022 (The day I broke the matrix) - So, it was just another day at work and while I was on my way home, I had a motorcycle accident. 
                It wasnt anything serious or life threatening but I shattered my femur and switched between medical leave and WFH for the next couple of months. WFH as a trainee 
                was not good, but my team was supportive and the workload was really low. Now I had an enormous amount of time to explore new frameworks, concepts, languages. I found the motivation and passion
                that I once lost by simply building projects, exploring new languages and frameworks. Somewhere down the line I learnt MERN stack and built a couple of projects. 
                After a while, I finally managed to land my first non-trainee role with my preferred tech stack.

                The Tann Mann Foundation - An average software engineer would say that working at a start-up will be a nightmare since you will be the frontend, backend, IT, testing, devops etc,. 
                but I loved every part of it, I didnt actually have to carry everything since we had around 10-15 software engineers in total. 
                I felt unshackled in a lot of ways, I dont have to raise a ticket to IT for installing software, didnt have to push my code to the testing team, didnt have to wait on other devs 
                for their response/contribution/approval, and much more. The best part is, my job 
                is WFH. so, my work-life balance has never been better and I still have time to work on my side projects every now and then. but it all comes with a cost, 
                the pay is not good and my company has fewer clients and none of them were big shots, once a product is pushed to production then there is not much to do with support.
            </p><br />
            <p style={{fontSize:'2.1rem'}}>
                In conclusion - I genuinely enjoy building projects and working on challenging environments, I wish to keep learning new tech rather than being stuck 
                with a particular tech stack or framework. My personal objective is to become a software engineer at FAANGM and work on revolutionary products that have a significant 
                impact on people's daily lives. well... Thats pretty much it, this is my life so far and I absolutely love it. If you find this blog or any of my projects interesting, 
                simply just reach out to me through any means, lets discuss/converse or just craft ideas and bring them to reality.
